# COVID Restaurant Reviews

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This application is geared towards those who may be at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 or anyone who is generally concerned about how restaurants are handling State and Local protocols. A user will be able to look up specific details about a certain restaurant. Such as: are employees wearing masks, are tables spaced at least 6ft apart and user comments pertaining to any other relatable information. If a user does not see that a specific restaurant already has a review, they can add the restaurant info. They will need to give the name of the restaurant and its location. If a user wishes to leave their own review, they can do so. If they wish to edit, update or delete their own review, they may do so at any time.
